This project presents a functional, single-page web interface for a Multiple Disease Prediction System, covering six conditions: Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkinson's, Liver Disease, Hepatitis, and Jaundice. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application features a modern two-column layout and includes a Dark Mode theme switcher that saves the user's preference in local storage. The JavaScript logic manages the entire front-end experience, including navigation between disease-specific forms, collecting input data, providing real-time field validation, and simulating a prediction. After a brief loading animation, the results are displayed in a formatted card showing a prediction probability percentage and a corresponding risk level with general health advice, all without needing a real backend API.
